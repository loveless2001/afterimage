# Verification — 7 September 2026

The prologue was tested with Node and headless Chromium on Linux in WSL. A native Windows browser was not available for direct testing. The Windows launcher is a simple `start` command opening the local HTML file; it has been inspected, not executed on Windows.

## Passed

- JavaScript syntax checks for `game.js` and `state.js`; shell syntax check for `serve-wsl.sh`.
- Four state tests: all legal retained-memory pairs and JSON round-trips; reset prerequisites; malformed-save rejection; valid ending saves.
- Full first-cycle traversal through normal browser controls: meet Moth, give the flower, read the terminal, listen to the receiver, choose retention, confirm reset.
- Complete second cycle with name + song: recognition scene, threshold refusal without relays, physical traversal to both relays, witness ending.
- Complete second cycle with name + route: recognition scene, shortcut without relays, witness option disabled, obedience ending.
- Complete second cycle with route + song: stranger reunion, shortcut without relays, stay ending.
- Export to a real JSON download, reload a completed game, import that save, reject a malformed import without altering current progress.
- Direct `file:` launch and loopback HTTP launch via the WSL helper.
- Import of the direct-file export into the separate localhost origin, followed by successful reload.
- Keyboard movement and shelf collision: a player moved into a shelf stopped outside its collision boundary.
- 1440 × 960 desktop and 390 × 844 narrow viewport screenshots inspected; no horizontal page overflow at the narrow size.
- Small-viewport pointer movement and interaction; dialogue focus containment; Escape; sound on/off.
- Storage-denied browser context: game remains playable and manual export still downloads.
- No page-level JavaScript errors and no external runtime requests in the complete direct-file journey tests.

State command:

```bash
node tests/state.test.cjs
```

Complete direct-file browser journey command used the existing Playwright installation available in this workspace:

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE=/home/lenovo/projects/openloop/node_modules/@playwright/test node tests/browser.cjs
```

The application does not depend on that repository or Playwright at runtime. To run the test elsewhere, point `PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE` at an existing Playwright package, or install Playwright in your own development environment. Set `GAME_URL` to test a hosted copy. Browser test artifacts were saved under `/tmp/afterimage-verification`; `preview.png` is the desktop archive capture included with this project.

Chromium and the loopback server required execution outside the tool sandbox because its process/socket restrictions blocked them. They ran successfully under the available automatic approval mechanism.

## Limits and next checks

- Native Windows Edge/Chrome/Firefox execution and the `.cmd` launcher still need a real Windows smoke test. The runtime has no compilation or external dependency to install.
- Human playtesting has not happened. The 8–12 minute length, emotional response, navigation clarity, and balance of memory choices are design targets.
- Mobile is a fallback layout, with a small overview of the archive; desktop/laptop remains the intended first-playtest target.
- Click-to-move follows a straight line with collision sliding, not automatic pathfinding. Walk around shelf ends. This is described in the menu.
- No controller support, key rebinding, full screen-reader spatial navigation, multiplayer, live model calls, combat, or later chapters are implemented.
- Browser local-storage behavior differs across direct-file origins and privacy settings; manual JSON transfer is the portable save path.

The initial prototype verification preceded repository creation. A local Git repository and the incident research library were added afterward at the user's request. The gameplay files were not changed by the research update; no push or public deployment was performed.
